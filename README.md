# Congress Analysis

### This is a repository that uses the Propublica API to analyze members of Congress in each state
* Information for the API can be found [here]

### The repository also uses Leaflet to create a map layered with state geoJSON information. By clicking on a state, a table will be returned with information for all members of Congress from that state
